For what use Inheritance:
1. Shorter code classes
2. Less to wright changings in code only for parent class
3. Easy to test classes
4.Gruping classes under parent type class ( Doctor and Driver are type Employee )
4. Extensibility it is,
   Example:
 	when Child extends Parent class, we can ctreate method or var with datatype as Parent class or any subclass of 
	 	public class Test1 {
  			public static void payrise(Employee e) {
				e.wage = e.wage + 100; }}

}}





# Inheritance of classes 
	Parent classes also has names ((Base class,Super class)
	Extends classes also has names (Derived classes,Subclasses,Child classes)

# Relationship of classes 
	"Is-a" and "Has a"
 Example: relationship Is-a"  Doctors is an Employee
 Example: relationship Has-a" Houuse has a Window


 Employee class(parent)
 Doctors class (Child of Employee)  
 Surgeons class (sublass of Doctors)

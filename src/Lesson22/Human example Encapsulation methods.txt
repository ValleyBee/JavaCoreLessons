#Example 1.Encapsulation:
 hiding some varaibles from access from outside
 use private access modifier for data to which we don't want to be accessed from outside classes.

 #StringBuilder create Mutable Objects
The mutable objects are objects whose value can be changed after initialization. 
StringBuilder has method append it can change var. 
 
 h.getSurname().append("xaxaxa"); // output changed surname;
 
 it isn't good for security to secure it we need make copy of object:
	instead of use code:

	 public StringBuilder getSurname() {
	 	return surname;
		}

use this code to make a copy of varaible:

		public StringBuilder getSurname() {
		  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(surname);
	     return sb;
		}

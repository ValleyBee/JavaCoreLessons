Public static void main(String [] arg) {
	String s1,s2;							STEP BY STEP					
	s1 = new String ("prvet");    s1 -> "privet"
	s2 = new String ("pola");     s2 -> "poka"
	s1 = s2;  					now   s1 -> "poka" (but s1 -> "privet" link deleted) object became eligible to
	String s3 = s1;					s3 -> "poka"
	s1 = null;							s1 -> null  (no link at all)
}  here finish Method main '}'  it means everything can became eligible for GC

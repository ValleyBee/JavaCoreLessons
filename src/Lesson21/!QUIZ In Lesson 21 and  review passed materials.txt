# TEST 1
output ?
3
6
9

nested ternary, how to find out ? 
need to followe the TRUE
int a = 7
(a > 2 ? a < 5 ? 3:6:9)  

if a > 2 TRUE then proceed further ->  a < 5 ? 3:6 -> output 6
if a > 2 FALSE then output 9


# TEST 2
there three Objects were created.
At which lines the Objects of reference varaible car1,car2,car3,car4 became eligable for GC ?


1. public class Car{ 
2. public static void main(String [] arg) {
3. Car car1 = new Car(); 	 (car1) at line 8 = null
4. Car car2 = new Car();    (car2) at line 9 = null
5. Car car3 = car1;
6. car1 = null;					
7. Car car4 = car1;				
8. car3 = null; 			<-					
9. car2 = null; 			<-					
10. car2 = new Car();			
11. System.gc();
12. }						 	<-	everything else at line 12 = end method main
13. }



â„– TEST 3 
What output of this code ?
at line 7 starts Recursive.

By ctreating an object Employee() at line 7 we go to Constructor of Class and inside 
class line 2 has code to create again new Object of Employee and so on. 


1. class Employee {
2.  Employee manager = new Employee();
3. }
4. class TestEmployee{
5. 	public static void main(String [] arg){
6. 	 	Employee e = null;
7.	 		e = new Employee();
8.			e = null;
9.	 }
10. }

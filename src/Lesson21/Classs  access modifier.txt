class Abc {

	  If class doesn't have (public) access modifier(or has a default) then all vars inside this class does not have it too. Even you put public access before var like (public int a;)
	  they have to have public access modifier both, class and vars.
	  only in this case they can be called form the other packeges

#EXample 1
if Constructor or Class not seen in other packeges you can't create  Abc a = new Abc();  in 
others packeges, because class or constructor have default access modifier
	  class Abc{
	  public int a =1;
	  }
#EX 2 seen in any packeges
	 public class Abc{    - public access modifier
	 public int a =1;
	 }
	
#EX 3 compliler not allowed	
constructor class Abc:
	public Abc() {  error, Recursive construction Abc()
		this(); here we call constructor again inside itself
	}

}
